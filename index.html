			<h4>Languages</h4>

			<h4>A little bit about Raynaldo</h4>
			<p>Raynaldo finds himself most comfortable in front of the computer googling online articles, watching movies or gaming. Thus, it is only natural that he has an affinity for coding. He enjoys writing codes, implementing new knowledge and debugging with the help of Stackoverflow while listening to his favourite songs online.</p>
			<p>An exposure to programming during one of his university courses stems his interest in it. After working in the construction sector under his family business, he decided to give programming a shot and attended Thinkful's Front-End Web Development Bootcamp.</p>
			<p>He has developed an application to ease the generation of site plan and calculation of materials needed to build small houses in Indonesia. The application is currently still in its testing phase and is planned to be deployed to help his family business soon.</p>
